![Graduation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Graduation-June%2012,%202026-6A4C93?style=for-the-badge)

I'm currently enrolled in an official Swedish Higher Vocational Education program (Yrkeshögskola) to become a **JavaScript Full-Stack Developer** at **Folkuniversitetet in Gothenburg, Sweden**.  
🗓️ I am on track to graduate and receive my post-secondary diploma on **June 12, 2026**.

My principal already refers to me as a **Full-Stack Developer**, as my work covers:

- **Frontend** – React, component architecture, state management, UI workflows  
- **Backend** – Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, authentication, data modeling  
- **Client-side engineering** – performance, rendering strategies, secure client logic  
- **Cloud & DevOps** – AWS, Render, serverless patterns, CI/CD, scalable deployments  

### In parallel, I work part time 50% as an **Fullstack Developer/System Architect & AI Engineer**,
### How ever my role has changed to be the one they call in to fix difficult tasks, jobs and debugging,
### So i am looking for a new part time 50% job to fill my hours.
