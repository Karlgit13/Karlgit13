- 👋 Hi, I’m @Karlgit13
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything that has to do with Development and coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web-development at Meta's Front-End Development Course, and also in a Game-development course at my local school!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me with the process of learning code more in depth!
